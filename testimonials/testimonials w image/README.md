Testimonials with profile image
------

Well, lets be real, when ever you are on a site searching for reviews for your next trip (screw you COVID-19 !!!) or checking if the new mouse you've been researching is the best. Everyone likes / trust more when they have a profile pic besides their *testimonial*.

This are the few things I don't get from Shopify, they are simple yet easily implementation changes that will help shops sell more.

I used **testimonial.liquid** as base (2019-03)

You'll see a few extra options:
+ checkbox > "Enable Image in Testimonials"
+ image picker > "Testimonial Image"
+ range > "Round corner"
+ radio > "Side for the image to appear"
+ radio > "Text Alignment"

How to install
------

###Adding Banner
1. Click [testimonial upgraded](https://github.com/taftera/shopify/blob/master/testimonials/testimonials%20w%20image/section/testimonials-upgraded.liquid) and copy all the text
2. Enter **Online Store** > **Actions** > **Edit Code**
3. Under **Section** > Click **Add a new section**
4. Rename it how you want it.
5. Paste all the text

Notes
------
If by any chance you cant see the mobile image displayed, double check the "Enable Mobile Banner" it has been a few times I've re-check my code for this simple thing.
