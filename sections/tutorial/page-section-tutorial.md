# Adding a SECTION to an Information Page

In this tutorial, I'll be adding the banner or (hero.liquid) to an information page.

Tutorial 
------
1. First as always, you need to identify which **SECTION** and where is the code stored. 
   - At the bottom I'll link to a list of the basic ones on the **Debut** template.
2. Once you've got the section you are looking for, make a copy of the code and rename it: *name*-*destination*. In my case will be *hero*-page.liquid. Since I've wanted to display a full width / adaptable image in my about page.
   - **Note:** due to the *settings_data.json* it's impossible to just link the section name to the final destination. Since it will take the variables from the front page edits and apply them to the page in question.

3. As we are working with a normal information page, we need to create a specific type of page for it to work. 
   - Go to **Templates**
   - Add a new template
   - Select **page** from the drop-down menu
   - Name your page. As we are creating an information page with a *hero.liquid* I'll name it **hero_one**.

4. When created, after a few seconds, it will auto-load some basic page code with it's title **{{ page.title }}** and information **{{ page.content }}**. Depending on where you want it to be displayed you allocate the following code:
```
{% section 'hero-page' %}
```

5. **SAVE !!!** always save, doesn't matter if you change a character or you are about to face a DarkSouls Boss. Just **SAVE**.
6. Go back the the admin panel *(HOME)* and click on *Online Store* > *Pages*
7. Add the page you want, and name it. Since I'm making an "About Us" page I'll name it just like it.

9. On the right side, there's a column with a block named "Visibility", the next block is named "Template" at the end of it, you'll see a drop-down, named "template-sufix" and a "page" selected. Click on it and select the page you just created. In my case: **page.hero_one**
9. On to the **Customization**. Go back the the admin panel *(HOME)* and click on *Online Store* > Click the *Customize* button.
10. On the top you'll see the name of the template you are working on *Alex Debut - DEV* and right next to it **Home page** with a "â–¼". Click and scroll for the page you created. In my case: About Us, under **PAGES**.

11. **TA-DAAA !** When loaded you'll see that there's the section you linked !

**Extra note:** If you want to add multiple diferent pages with the same **SECTION**, sadly you'll need to create another copy of the SECTION and repeat the process. Well, until I find a better way.
