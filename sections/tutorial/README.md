# Shopify Section Importing Tutorial
When starting with Shopify, you are always guessing:
- Why can't I just add that SECTION to the *this* page I'm currently on.

Well, honestly I could't find the right documentation about it, but I always love to tweak or test the code and how it manages to work (mostly breaks, but that's just part of the fun of it).

Since there are slight diferences with each type of page (product page / blog / information page), I'll list each one just to make it extra easy.
