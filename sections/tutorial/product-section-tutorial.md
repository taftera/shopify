# Adding a SECTION to a Product Page

In this tutorial, I'll be adding the newly developed [highlight banner](https://github.com/taftera/shopify-help) (*.liquid) to every Product Page

Tutorial 
------
1. First as always, you need to identify which **SECTION** and where is the code stored. 
   - Since we are just using the one in the highlight banner from previous  tutorial, it will be easier this time.
   - As well, at the bottom I'll add a link to a list of the basic ones on the **Debut** template.

2. Once you've got the section you are looking for, make a copy of the code and rename it: *name*-*destination*. In my case will be *highlight-banner*-product.liquid . This will allow us to display a a band with multiple options to assure our visitors simple information.
   - **Note:** due to the *settings_data.json* it's impossible to just link the section name to the final destination. Since it will take the variables from the front page edits and apply them to the page in question.

3. This example is a bit easier than the information page, open the *product.liquid* inside the Templates folder. And since we just need to add the code:

```
{% section 'highlight-banner-product' %}
```

- Where we want it:
   - Over 'product-template' (beneath the header)
   
   ![placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/460x120.png?text=@taftera+Github+Tutorial)
   - Under 'product-template' (beneath the product and over the 'product-recommendation')
   
   ![placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/460x120.png?text=@taftera+Github+Tutorial)
   - Or just above the footer (under the other 2 previous sections)

4. **Save**.

5. Go to the admin panel *(HOME)* and click on *Online Store* > Click the **Customize** button.

6. On the top you'll see the name of the template you are working on *Alex Debut - DEV* and right next to it **Home page** with a "â–¼". Click and scroll for the **Product pages**.

11. **TA-DAAA !** When loaded you'll see that there's the section you linked ! 
    - **Note:** Sadly product and information pages, can't arrange the sections position (just like I mentioned in **bullet 3**). So if you want to display the highlight banner in a different height, you need to go back to the *product.liquid*.
