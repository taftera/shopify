# Shopify Help
All shopify sections / tweeks / help. I've learnt in a while

------

Hi I'm Alex ([@taftera](https://twitter.com/TafterA)) and I've been learning about **Shopify** for a few years and I always find myself creating the same *sections* adding the same *filters* to multiple developments.
The information is so spread out that people get lost, well I did get lost (multiple times).

------

Before starting, all my Shopify developments are based in the **Debut** template.

If you found this repository helpful, and wish to help out. A donation is a great way for me to keep going at it.
