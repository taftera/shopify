All shopify sections / tweeks / help. I've learnt in a while

### Hi I'm Alex ([@taftera](https://twitter.com/TafterA)) 
I've been learning about **Shopify** for a few years and I always find myself creating the same *sections* adding the same *filters* to multiple developments.
The information is so spread out that people get lost, well I did get lost (multiple times).

------

Before starting, all my Shopify developments are based in the **Debut** template.

Developments
------
1. **Banner with mobile specific image and text alignment** - [Go to project](../tree/master/banner/banner w mobile img/)
2. **next** - [project](#)

If you found this repository helpful, and wish to help out, send me a message [@taftera](https://twitter.com/TafterA)
Or a donation is a great way to help me to keep going at it.
