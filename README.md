### Hi I'm Alex ([@taftera](https://twitter.com/TafterA)) 
I've been learning about **Shopify** for a few years and I always find myself creating the same *sections* adding the same *filters* to multiple developments.
The information is so spread out that people get lost, well I did get lost (multiple times).

------

Before starting, all my Shopify developments are based in the **Debut** template.

Developments
------
1. **Mobile specific image and text** for main banner - [Go to project](https://github.com/taftera/shopify/tree/master/banner/banner%20w%20mobile%20img)
2. **Profile image addition** for testimonials - [Go to project](https://github.com/taftera/shopify/tree/master/testimonials/testimonials%20w%20image)
3. **Highlight banner** with image/SVG and text - [Go to project](https://github.com/taftera/shopify-help/tree/master/banner/highlight%20banner)
