### Hi I'm Alex ([@taftera](https://twitter.com/TafterA)) 
I've been learning about **Shopify** for a few years and I always find myself creating the same *sections* adding the same *filters* to multiple developments.
The information is so spread out that people get lost, well I did get lost (multiple times).

------

Before starting, all my Shopify developments are based in the **Debut** template.

------

Developments
------
1. **Banner with mobile specific image and text alignment** - [Go to project](https://github.com/taftera/shopify/tree/master/banner/banner%20w%20mobile%20img)
2. **Testimonials with Profile Image** - [Go to project](https://github.com/taftera/shopify/tree/master/testimonials/testimonials%20w%20image)

To Do
------
1. Tutorial to "import" sections in Product page / Blog / Pages.
2. "Highlight" banner container w/img and text inserting.
3. Swipe Gallery for image banner.
4. Swipe Gallery for products.
5. Menu update.
